Just a brief overview, I was born in Ventura California to El Salvadorean immigrants, joined the Marine Corps after graduating High School in 2007, deployed to Iraq in 2009, married my high school sweet heart in 2011, we had four kids and moved to Pittsburgh, New Orleans, North Carolina, and Kansas City where I was honorably discharged after 13 years. My wife and I and our 4 kids now consider ourselfs Kansas Citians and enjoy living the midwest life.
